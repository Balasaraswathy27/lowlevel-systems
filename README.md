This repository contains my hands-on practice with low-level programming, including:

          BIOS programming and interrupts
          
          Bootloader development in x86 assembly
          
          Keyboard and screen handling at the bare-metal level
          
          Basic OS concepts and memory management

The goal is to learn firmware, bootloaders, and operating system fundamentals from scratch, working directly with hardware and BIOS interfaces.
